          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>A love for reading was instilled into me early on by my parents, and as I grew older, I found that my love for reading hadn’t diminished and that it was able to help me wonder about the world in a meaningful way. I found myself asking questions that had no apparent answers, and I was not equipped with the tools to explore possible answers myself. I would not find these tools until university when I took my first philosophy class on a whim. I discovered a passion for studies, and quickly came to realize that the best way to better myself was to pursue a competency in this newfound discipline.</p>
          <p>I am interested in 19th and 20th Century philosophy, particularly within the French tradition. My primary focus has been on interpersonal relationships, ethics, existentialism, phenomenology, and responsibility. I am interested in the philosophies of Sartre, Levinas, Heidegger, Camus, Derrida, and Baudrillard. Recently I have been trying to make my way through Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception. Furthermore, I am somewhat troubled by LLMs and their effects on students. Contre Michel Serres, I see this up-and-coming technology as a detriment to thought.</p>
          <p>Professionally, I hope to explore ideas within phenomenology and existentialism. I am currently interested in the differences in existential thought that arise between Cartesian and non-Cartesian understandings of our existence.</p>
